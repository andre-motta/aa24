Does 42==44?

If we watched 100 women and men walk past us and their mean walking tipped was 42 and 44 cm/second (for men and women respectively), it is true that men walk faster than women?

This is an example of the problem of comparing distributions. These problem as two parts:

- Are the distributions distinguishable?
  - If we picked a number from one distibtuion, can we tell of it can be found on the other?
  - THis is the (badly named) singificance test.
- Is the different between them non-trivial:
  - This is the effect size test
  - And we want to ignore small effects.
